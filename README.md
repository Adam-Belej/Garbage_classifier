# Garbage_classifier


## Description
**The main goals of this repository are to:**
- Create a functional neural network
- Create python scripts for editing and augmenting images to fit a specified size for the network
- Keep track of all progress as the whole project will be used to write a publication for the SOÄŒ competition


## Dependencies
### Python packages:
- pillow <https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/>
- katna <https://pypi.org/project/katna/>


## Road map
### Already done:
- Created backgrounds for dataset photos from paper and graphite
- Added first dataset images to the cloud folder
- wrote a script in katna for rescaling dataset images to be squares
- created a doc with dataset specs
- wrote a script to resize and augment dataset pictures using pillow library
- finished making the dataset tools
- made major progress creating the dataset

#### Currently working on:
- make alfonzo work while inheriting from clasifier 


### To do:
- [x] Create dataset tools [done]
    - [x] Create data set specification
    - [x] Create bash scripts
- [ ] Create dataset [mid october]
- [ ] Write neural network [by the end of october]
- [ ] Test accuracy [end of october]
- [ ] Write paper [mid november]
- [ ] Final changes to the paper + submit [end of november]
- [ ] Great success
